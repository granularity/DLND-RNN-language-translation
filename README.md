### Train a sequence-to-sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset) in TensorFlow.

This is the fourth project in Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The program covers topics like Keras and TensorFlow, convolutional and recurrent networks, deep reinforcement learning, and GANs. 

In this project, I implemented a machine translation sequence-to-sequence recurrent network for English to French translation on a simple dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.
